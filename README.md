# 🎥 Text-to-Video Generation using Diffusion and Interpolation

This project enables the creation of smooth, realistic videos from text prompts using **Stable Diffusion** models from **Hugging Face**. The system generates a sequence of images from a prompt and enhances them using **frame interpolation**, resulting in a fluid video output.
